    <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p> The PlayStation VR, known by the codename <a href= "http://www.playstation.com/en-ie/explore/playstation-vr/" target="_blank"><u>Project Morpheus</u></a> during development, is a virtual reality headset developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment, which was released in October 2016. 
It was designed to be fully functional with the PlayStation 4 home video game console. In certain games and demos for the VR, the player wearing the headset acts separately from other players without the headset. <em>The PlayStation VR</em> system can output a picture to both the PlayStation VR headset and a television simultaneously, with the television either mirroring the picture displayed on the headset, or displaying a separate image for competitive or cooperative gameplay. PlayStation VR works with either the standard DualShock 4 controller or the PlayStation Move controllers.

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  
    
                <p>It was revealed the headset would have three rendering modes for developers to choose from: native 90 Hz, native 120 Hz, and a mode where gameplay running at 60 Hz would be displayed at 120 Hz using a motion interpolation technique called asynchronous reprojection.[23] The interpolation would be achieved with little system resources and a small latency of under 18 milliseconds. The technique would also be utilised in the native 120 Hz mode to ensure consistent framerate. According to a Sony representative the company expects the interpolated 120 Hz mode to be a popular choice for games. 
PlayStation VR games can send different perspectives to the headset and television.

  <h2>What you can do with PlayStation VR</h2>
                  <p>Gaming is great, but it isn't everything!
While you're taking a break from gaming, you might be wondering what else your glowing headset can do. Here are a few non-gaming things you can try out to get the most out of your PlayStation VR</p>
<p>Watch some impressive 360-degree videos.
One of the best parts of PlayStation VR is the almost complete lack of screen-door effect. The clear image translates really well when it comes to watching regular movies and TV shows in apps like Netflix and Hulu.</p>
<p>Relive memories with your photos in VR
The PS4 Media Player is a powerful app that pulls media from a connected USB storage device or, if you have one set up, a media server. Check out all your vacation photos from last year, and even have a look at any 360-degree media you've created or downloaded.</p>

<p>Experiment with other operating systems
Thanks to the standalone processing unit that sits next to your PS4, you can technically hook your PlayStation VR up to anything with an HDMI port. We already wrote a guide on watching 360-degree videos on your Mac, but the fun doesn't stop there.
Connecting the HDMI cable to an Xbox One or a WiiU will give you a picture in your PlayStation VR â€” just don't expect real VR immersion, as this isn't the native platform and there is no head tracking. Still, it's fun to experiment, and playing other games on the enormous screen is a thrill.</p>

                   <p> Reviews from most publications were positive; critics praised the PSVR's physical design, ease to use, and availability. Compared to other headsets that require high-end computers, the PSVR only required a PS4. Most criticism was aimed at the system's performance, noting the PS4 offers less compute power than the high-end PCs required to run Oculus Rift and HTC Vive games.

<h2>Sales</h2>

<p>As of February 19, 2017, PlayStation VR has sold over 915,000 units. Andrew House, the President and Global CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), the company behind the PlayStation VR, stated that the sales of the VR was far beyond expectations. On June 5, 2017, the number of PlayStation VR units sold has passed 1 million. Sony announced the PlayStation VR had sold over 2 million units and 12.2 million games on December 3, 2017.</p>
